# Modern Tech Stack for Jam3a-2.0 Rebuild

Based on the analysis of the existing Jam3a-2.0 repository, I'm designing a modern tech stack that will address the current issues while providing a robust foundation for future development. This tech stack is specifically optimized for Digital Ocean deployment.

## Frontend Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Next.js 14** (replacing Vite + React Router)
  - Server components for improved performance
  - Built-in API routes eliminating the need for separate server
  - Automatic code splitting and optimized loading
  - Static and dynamic rendering options
  - Built-in image optimization

- **TypeScript**
  - Strict type checking for improved code quality
  - Better developer experience with enhanced IDE support

- **TailwindCSS**
  - Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
  - Built-in responsive design capabilities

### UI Components
- **Shadcn UI** (based on Radix UI)
  - Accessible, customizable component library
  - Copy-paste components with no external dependencies
  - Fully typed components

### State Management
- **TanStack Query** (formerly React Query)
  - Data fetching, caching, and state management
  - Automatic refetching and background updates

- **Zustand** (replacing Context API)
  - Lightweight state management
  - Simple API with hooks-based approach
  - Better performance than Context API

### Form Handling
- **React Hook Form** with **Zod** validation
  - Performance-focused form handling
  - Type-safe schema validation

## Backend Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Next.js API Routes** (replacing Express server)
  - Serverless architecture for better scalability
  - Simplified deployment with frontend and backend in one codebase
  - Edge runtime options for global performance

- **Prisma** (replacing direct Mongoose usage)
  - Type-safe database client
  - Automatic migrations
  - Better query performance and connection pooling
  - Support for MongoDB while providing relational database features

### Authentication
- **NextAuth.js**
  - Secure, flexible authentication
  - Multiple authentication providers
  - Session management
  - CSRF protection built-in

### Data Validation
- **Zod**
  - Runtime type validation
  - Consistent validation between frontend and backend

## DevOps & Deployment

### Build & Development
- **Turborepo**
  - Monorepo support for better code organization
  - Incremental builds for faster development
  - Caching for improved CI/CD performance

### Deployment
- **Docker**
  - Containerized deployment for consistency
  - Optimized for Digital Ocean App Platform
  - Multi-stage builds for smaller production images

- **Digital Ocean App Platform**
  - Simplified deployment process
  - Built-in monitoring and scaling
  - Automatic HTTPS

### Monitoring & Analytics
- **Google Analytics** (as specified)
  - Server-side implementation for better performance
  - Respect for user privacy settings

- **Sentry**
  - Error tracking and performance monitoring
  - Real-time alerts for issues

## Testing
- **Vitest** (replacing Jest)
  - Faster test execution
  - Compatible with Vite's module system

- **Testing Library**
  - Component testing with user-centric approach
  - Integration with Next.js

- **Playwright**
  - End-to-end testing
  - Cross-browser testing

## Additional Tools
- **ESLint & Prettier**
  - Code quality and formatting
  - Custom rules for consistent code style

- **Husky & lint-staged**
  - Pre-commit hooks for code quality
  - Automated formatting and linting

This tech stack represents a significant modernization of the existing Jam3a-2.0 application, addressing the deployment issues while providing a more robust, maintainable, and performant foundation for future development.
